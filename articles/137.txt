Washington is barely functioning–the president and vice president are both ill, one-third of Congress is dead or incapacitated.” People involved in that simulation were Tom Daschle (former leader of US Senate), Dr. Julie Gerberding (former head CDC), Jim Talen (former Missouri senator)–Why are all of these people keeping quiet right now, and not telling us what they saw in the global virus pandemic simulation only two years ago, and helping lead us out of this mess, with some new simulations???!!!The most important lesson to learn is that you always need to keep a spare ventilator in your garage.
